{"key":"about_description","value":"The goal of the project is to implement during the course of one semester an application that uses virtual reality (VR) to simulate indoor movement of a person exhibiting common conditions of the elderly such as cataracts or orientation disorders. The application will allow to visualise the impact of accommodations designed for the elderly (e.g. colour palette, lighting, contrast, etc.) on their lives.\n\nRealization of the project will come to fruition thanks to interdisciplinary cooperation between the Faculty of AEI and Architecture. As part of the project the team will explore available possibilities of VR hardware, technics of image processing, methods of creation and processing of digital models.\n\nThe final product of the project will be a tool utilizing a virtual reality application to assist with architecture design conforming to the guidelines of Lab60+ and allow to empathise with the problems and needs of the elderly."},
